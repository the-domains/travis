I believe in technology, innovation, and leadership. 
Get the right tools, build new tools to meet future challenges, and inspire people to build great organizations that will make that happen. I focus on Defense, Energy, and Advanced Manufacturing in the space between government, military, academic institutions, and growing tech companies.
