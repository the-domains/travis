President Obama and Secretary of Defense Carter are both in the news today touting entrepreneurship, and how it can transform the economy and the military, respectively. 

* Department of Defense Head Ashton Carter Enlists Silicon Valley to Transform the Military: [http://www.wired.com/2015/11/secretary-of-defense-ashton-carter/][0]

Wired magazine, focused on the intersection of technology and culture, seems to be welcoming Secretary Carter with open arms. His tireless outreach efforts are aimed at repairing the relationship between Defense and Silicon Valley, and could pay large dividends if Defense can reform its acquisition process to accommodate small, nimble technology developers.
